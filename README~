Comments: Just use 'make' and then './weenix -n'. Once in kshell, enter 'vtest' to run the tests for kernel 2.

Is there are any tests in the standard test suite that you know that it's not
working and you don't want the grader to run it at all so you won't get extra
deductions, please list them here.  (Of course, if the grader won't run these
tests, you will not get plus points for them.)
