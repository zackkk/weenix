/*
 * There a number of steps to opening a file:
 *      1. Get the next empty file descriptor.
 *      2. Call fget to get a fresh file_t.
 *      3. Save the file_t in curproc's file descriptor table.
 *      4. Set file_t->f_mode to OR of FMODE_(READ|WRITE|APPEND) based on
 *         oflags, which can be O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR, possibly OR'd with
 *         O_APPEND.
 *      5. Use open_namev() to get the vnode for the file_t.
 *      6. Fill in the fields of the file_t.
 *      7. Return new fd.
 *
 * If anything goes wrong at any point (specifically if the call to open_namev
 * fails), be sure to remove the fd from curproc, fput the file_t and return an
 * error.
 *
 * Error cases you must handle for this function at the VFS level:
 *      o EINVAL
 *        oflags is not valid.
 *      o EMFILE
 *        The process already has the maximum number of files open.
 *      o ENOMEM
 *        Insufficient kernel memory was available.
 *      o ENAMETOOLONG
 *        A component of filename was too long.
 *      o ENOENT
 *        O_CREAT is not set and the named file does not exist.  Or, a
 *        directory component in pathname does not exist.
 *      o EISDIR
 *        pathname refers to a directory and the access requested involved
 *        writing (that is, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR is set).
 *      o ENXIO
 *        pathname refers to a device special file and no corresponding device
 *        exists.
